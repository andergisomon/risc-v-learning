# RISC-V Assembly Learning
Code I wrote to document my learning journey with RISC-V assembly on the ESP32-C3.

To compile the assembly source: Simply git clone and run the following commands in the project directory:

```idf.py fullclean```

```idf.py build```

And flash to your dev board. On Windows you can use Device Manager under Ports (COM)

```idf.py -p COM8 flash```

Replace COM8 with your appropriate port.
